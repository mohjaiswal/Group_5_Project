![TerraCarbon Header](headerterracarbon.png)

TerraCarbon is a unique platform aimed at connecting carbon credit buyers and sellers. With a mission to contribute positively to the planet, TerraCarbon introduces a fungible token for trading carbon credits, fostering a journey towards carbon neutrality.

## Procedure

- **Jupyter Notebook Development:** Using Pandas and APIs to track users' carbon emissions.
- **Token Specifications:** Defining TerraCarbon token's name, symbol, total supply, and decimal places.
- **Smart Contract Development:** Writing an ERC-20 compliant smart contract with functions like transfer, approve, and balanceOf.
- **Smart Contract Deployment:** Utilizing Remix IDE to deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **User Interface Creation:** Developing a React-based user interface for interacting with the smart contract and trading carbon credits.
- **DEX Implementation:** Establishing a decentralized exchange for trading carbon credits using TerraCarbon tokens.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Enabling transfer and withdrawal of funds through the deployed smart contract.
- **Demo Video Creation:** Producing a video showcasing all the aforementioned steps.

## Importance

Using TerraCarbon tokens for trading carbon credits offers multiple advantages:

1. **Reduced Transaction Costs:** Avoiding third-party transaction fees, making trading more accessible.
2. **Faster Settlement:** Enabling near-instant transaction settlements.
3. **Enhanced Transparency:** Leveraging blockchain technology for a secure, auditable ledger.
4. **Increased Liquidity:** Allowing 24/7 trading, facilitating easier buying and selling.
5. **Wider Accessibility:** Making carbon credit trading more reachable globally.

Note: While beneficial, token-based trading also presents challenges like price volatility and regulatory compliance.

## Smart Contract and ERC Standard

- **Smart Contract Features:** Our TerraCarbon token smart contract allows minting, transferring, and exchanging tokens.

# Background

Our project begins with a focus on Carbon Credits' significance. We utilized Python to generate graphs depicting global emissions and population trends.

- **Population Growth Graphs:** Visualizing global and country-specific population growth.
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Analyzing emissions data to understand environmental impact.
- **Graphical Insights:** Customizable visualizations highlighting key trends in emissions and population.

## Sources

- **Carbon Footprint API:** For tracking carbon emissions data ([Carbon Footprint API](https://rapidapi.com/carbonandmore-carbonandmore-default/api/carbonfootprint1)).
- **Global Emissions Data:** Hannah Ritchie, Max Roser and Pablo Rosado's "COâ‚‚ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions" ([OurWorldInData.org](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)).
